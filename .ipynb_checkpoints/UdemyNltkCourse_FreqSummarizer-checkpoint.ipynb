      "NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat's 'lion and dog' remark made at the World Hindu Congress in Chicago on Saturday drew criticism from activists and politicians.Urging the Hindu community leaders to unite and work for the betterment of the mankind, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had said that Hindus have no aspiration of dominance and the community will prosper only when it works as a society.\"If a lion is alone, wild dogs can invade and destroy the lion.We must not forget that.We want to make the world better.We have no aspiration of dominance.Our influence is not a result of conquest or colonisation,” he said.Questioning Bhagwat who did he refer to, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President, Asaduddin Owaisi said that the Indian constitution refers everybody as humans.\"So who are dogs and the lion?Indian Constitution defines everyone as humans & doesn't treat them as dogs or lion.The problem with RSS is that they don't believe in Indian constitution,\" said Owaisi.Owaisi further remarked that he was not surprised by the RSS chief statement since this has been their language for years.\"They (RSS) have their weird ideas to demean people by calling others dogs and assuming themselves as the lion.This has been the language of RSS from last 90 years and I am not surprised.People of India will reject such crass and crude language,\" said the AIMIM leader.Bhagwat's statement also drew criticism from Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh leader Prakash Ambedkar.Condemning Bhagwat's statement, Ambedkar, claimed that the \"dog\" reference was for the \"Opposition parties\" in the country.\"I condemn this 'mansikta' (mentality) of Mohan Bhagwat that he has referred to Opposition parties in the country as dogs,\" Ambedkar said.He said parties have come and gone out of power but this mentality indicated that the ruling dispensation thinks that the opposition cannot fight them.He claimed that it was this mentality that led to the imprisonment of RSS functionaries in 1949 by then deputy Prime Minister Sardar Patel.The RSS members were released subsequently but the organisation has, ever since, been misusing its freedom, alleged Ambedkar.\"I believe people should rethink before bringing them to power again,\" he said.The second World Hindu Congress organised in Chicago, US, marked the commemoration of the 125th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda's historic speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893 in Chicago.While addressing a gathering of some 2,500 delegates, Bhagwat said one of the key values to bring the whole world into a team is to have controlled ego and learn to accept the consensus.\"Hindus don't live to oppose anybody.We even allow the pests to live.There are people who may oppose us.You have to tackle them without harming them,\" Bhagwat said.(With inputs from agencies)\n"
